This is the system created by Camcycle (Cambridge Cycling Campaign) to survey candidates in the election each year.

See: https://www.camcycle.org.uk/elections/

It aims to encourage candidates to give well thought-out responses, on specific, topical issues, rather than meaningless yes/no answers.

Candidates are surveyed on a per-ward basis, and practice so far has been to have a mix of localised and more strategic questions for each ward.

The aims are to:

* To enable voters, particularly the organisation's members, to see what candidates' views are, and what they are offering
* Enable the organisation to introduce themselves to candidates (and thus future elected public representatives)
* Encourage candidates to think about the issues, both locally and in a more strategic, area-wide sense
* To get comments that are useful, well thought-out, on specific, topical issues, rather than relatively meaningless yes/no answers
* Obtain commitments from candidates
* To have their comments be made and remain in public
* To enable a non-partisan organisation to be able to publish comments from politicians in a neutral way, such that voters can make up their own minds


## Funding

This system has so far been created in the spare time of the authors, but there is much scope to improve it.

Funding is sought to enable the system to be moved to the next level. If you are interested to provide a grant for its improvement, please do get in touch.
